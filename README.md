# Join Practice

Use the `world.sql` file to answer the following questions.

Remember, you can use the `.schema` command in the sqlite terminal to see the
format of all the current tables. It looks something like this:

```
sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE city (
    id integer NOT NULL,
    name text NOT NULL,
    countrycode character(3) NOT NULL,
    district text NOT NULL,
    population integer NOT NULL,
);
CREATE TABLE country (
    code character(3) NOT NULL,
    name text NOT NULL,
    continent text NOT NULL,
    region text NOT NULL,
    surfacearea real NOT NULL,
    indepyear smallint,
    population integer NOT NULL,
    lifeexpectancy real,
    gnp numeric(10,2),
    gnpold numeric(10,2),
    localname text NOT NULL,
    governmentform text NOT NULL,
    headofstate text,
    capital integer,
    code2 character(2) NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE countrylanguage (
    countrycode character(3) NOT NULL,
    "language" text NOT NULL,
    isofficial boolean NOT NULL,
    percentage real NOT NULL
);
```

## Find the Capital of Brazil
Write a query that returns the name of the capitol and the country for Brazil.

```
name        name      
----------  ----------
Brasilia  Brazil    
```

## Languages Spoken in the United States
Write a query that returns the name of each language and its percentage, ordered
from top to bottom starting with the highest percentage for just the United States.

## Percentage French Where Official

Query for the name of the country, the language, the percentage of the language, and
the state of whether the language `isofficial` for French.

```
name        language    percentage  isofficial
----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
Monaco      French      41.900002   t
